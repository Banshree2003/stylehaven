        The sheer range of stylish outfits for women is huge. However, finding the right outfit for any occasion is a tricky part. An embroidered or printed shirt dress goes well with any occasion and works even as office wear due to its minimal stylings and chic look. But if you need a total boss lady look, go for a solid shirt with neutral colour trousers and a checked blazer, and a pair of black heels to add a finishing touch. While on vacation, keep it simple with a printed or graphic tee and a pair of washed shorts. To get the best women's clothing online, get your hands on the Pantaloons app.

        Accessories that go with Stylish Outfit for Women
        Accessories add that touch of detailing to elevate the look of any stylish outfits for women. Pair your formal dresses with a slim belt to elevate your waistline and a simple watch. Indian outfits are absolutely incomplete without the accessories however if done over the top, it steals the spotlight from the dress. Style your printed Indian outfits with a pair of heavy earrings to carry them with grace. For solid-coloured kurtas or sarees, a statement piece such as a pearl choker will get the job done.
